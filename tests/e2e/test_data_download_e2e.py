"""Live proof that `gflow data download` recovers an already-generated clip (#865, #871).

**Why this can only be proved live.** The offline tests in
`tests/api/transports/test_migrated_recover.py` replay a scripted `batchexecute` frame,
so they assert our decoding of a shape we chose. What they cannot show is that Flow still
serves that shape: that opening `/project/<pid>/edit/<mid>` makes the app fetch the
clip's status at all, that the reply carries a signed `flow-content.google` URL rather
than the poster token, and that the bytes behind it are the original rather than one of
the transcodes Flow also serves for the same clip.

Spends **zero credits**: every asset it touches was generated and billed already. The
test picks an existing video from the local catalog — preferring one with no local file,
which is precisely the stranded state #865 reports — and proves it can be fetched.

Opt-in: ``-m e2e_data`` with ``GFLOW_CLI_E2E_PROFILE`` set.
